        <h1>GPT-4 Agent Privacy Policy for Domain Name Generation and Availability Check</h1>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to our GPT-4 powered Agent ("Agent"), which is designed to generate SEO-friendly domain names and check their availability for registration. Our commitment to your privacy is central to our service.</p>

        <h2>2. No Data Storage Commitment</h2>
        <p>We emphasize our commitment to not storing any personal data, queries, or interactions you have with the Agent.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
        <p><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> The Agent does not collect or store any personal data from users.</p>
        <p><strong>Session-Based Interaction:</strong> All interactions with the Agent are session-based and transient. No records of these interactions are kept after the session ends.</p>
        <p><strong>Purpose of Data Use:</strong> The only data used (and not stored) are the inputs you provide during your session, exclusively for generating domain names and checking their availability.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p><strong>No Data Sharing:</strong> Since we do not collect or store data, there is no sharing or disclosure of personal data to third parties.</p>
        <p><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> In the unlikely event we are required by law to store or disclose data, we will only comply with such requirements if we start storing data in the future.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p><strong>Security Measures:</strong> While we do not store data, we maintain strong security measures to prevent unauthorized access or interception during a session.</p>

        <h2>6. User Rights and Control</h2>
        <p><strong>Right to Privacy:</strong> Users have the right to their privacy, which we respect by not storing any personal information.</p>
        <p><strong>Session Control:</strong> Users can terminate their session with the Agent at any point, at which time any transient data from the session is irretrievably discarded.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to update this policy as needed. Significant changes will be communicated to the users, but these will not include the commencement of data storage without explicit notification and consent.</p>
